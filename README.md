# Divide and Conquer: Majority Element
<br/>

__Repo description:__
<br/>
This repo stores the code written by myself, Kristen Phan, as part of a Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/). Implemented are 3 different algorithms with different runtimes:
<br/>
1. Naive algo: O(n^2)
2. Divide-and-conquer algo: O(nlogn)
3. Hash map algo: O(n)
<br/>

__Assignment description__:
<br/>
Input: A sequence of n ≤ 10^5 integers.
Output: 1, if there is an element that is repeated more than n/2 times, and 0 otherwise.
<br/>

__Disclaimer__: If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
